#Travel Site Demo

This is a demo project I built to practice current skills and learn several new ones. It pulls together many tools and topics, including:

* ES6
* Babel
* Webpack
* PostCSS
* Browsersync
* Node and NPM
* A basic build and deploy system w/Gulp scripts
* A more modular approach to JavaScript and CSS
* Some CSS techniques, like transitions and transforms
* A fully "mobile first" approach

Feel free to clone, and any comments or critique are most welcome.

This project leverages images and a basic visual design from @LearnWebCode.
